# Coding conventions

## General

- Where possible, don't add superfluous comments that just repeat what should be
  obvious from method/function names etc. Only add comments if it's really not
  obvious what's going on.

## Python

- Add modern type annotations whenever possible.
- Minimize docstrings unless functions are re-usable.
