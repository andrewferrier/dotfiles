# This command can be used as an argument in an exec command as part of a git
# interactive rebase to remove superfluous whitespace changes from commits. It
# will leave commits clean and tidy, with only changes that you really wanted.
#
# For example:
#
# git rebase -i --exec git-rebase-filter-remove-whitespace HEAD~5
#
# ... will remove whitespace changes from the last 5 commits.
#
# TODO:
# * Currently any whitespace changes are stashed away at the end for
#   safe-keeping. Stop doing that.
# * Test more rigorously (unit tests?)

git reset HEAD^
git diff --ignore-all-space --no-color | git apply --cached --ignore-whitespace
git commit -c ORIG_HEAD
git stash
